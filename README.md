Movie Discovery and Recommendations

Team Members: Michael Castro, Gordon Brown, Nana Kofi Brenya, Luke Walsh, Mikolaj Jakub Majewski

Topic: Movie Discovery & Recommendations

Project Description:
    In today's digital age, the movie industry is booming with an ever-increasing number of films being released every year. With such a vast array of options available, it can be overwhelming for movie enthusiasts to keep track of trending movies, explore different genres, and discover hidden gems. For our team to address this need, we have developed a movie collection interface, which will provide users with a centralized platform to explore and gain knowledge about trending movies based on ratings, genres, release dates, and more. And also which streaming services (Netflix, Hulu, Plex, Amazon prime, etc) those movies are available to watch them.

Description of target browser (iOS? Android? Which one): 
    This application has been tested on both Apple safari and Google chrome browser and on Mac and windows desktop computers, Android and Iphone including their associated tablets. Although the application can work on both browers and devices, it works seamlessly on Google chrome browser with CORS activated due to voice command feature.
